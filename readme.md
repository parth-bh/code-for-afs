## Code for AFS

AFS, a non-governmental organization (NGO), is dedicated to conducting international exchange programs. Their selection process relies on examinations, and they maintain multiple centers across India. With approximately 500 student applicants, AFS requires the expertise of a coder to handle essential tasks, including data manipulation, following the completion of the exams. Below are the specific objectives of the code:

### Objectives:

1. Locate Nearest Centers: Develop a code that determines the nearest AFS centers based on the current geographical locations of the students. This information can be crucial for logistics and allocation.

2. Data Manipulation for Student Selection: Create a code that performs data manipulation after each round of student selection. This ensures a fair and efficient process for selecting participants in the exchange program.


### Technologies Used:
For this project, the primary technology stack includes Python and its associated libraries for effective data manipulation and geospatial analysis. Specifically, the following technologies have been utilized:

1. Python: The core programming language employed for code development and implementation.

2. Pandas/Numpy: These libraries have been instrumental in efficiently handling and manipulating data, enabling seamless processing of student information.

3. Geopy: Utilized for geospatial analysis, Geopy has been employed to calculate the distances between student locations and the available AFS centers. This functionality aids in determining the nearest centers for logistical purposes and program coordination.
